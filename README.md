# RGR-Famicom-PiPU-Adpator
Working log/info with ANYTHING about Famicom PiPU adaptor from RGR https://retrogamerestore.com/


*  The source code of FX2LP firmware, NES-ROM, modification of SDL2, modification of chocolate-DOOM, DOOM settings and major data-exchanging application running in Linux are in the other repo: https://github.com/martinx72/PiPU
*  You can find some binary files here. e.g. full pack of FX2LP firmware binary, the update boot file or image for certain SBC (Single Board Computer).
*  Will try to add more info/tutorial to build compatible emulator or game as possible as I can when I have some free time.
